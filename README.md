## About The Project

This is an extension for JetBrains IDEs that integrates ChatGPT into your coding environment.
By leveraging the power of GPT-3, this makes it an invaluable tool for developers looking to streamline their workflow and gain a deeper understanding of the code they're working on.

## Getting Started

To get started, follow these simple steps:

### Prerequisites

In order to use the extension, you need to have a JetBrains IDE installed and the API key configured.
You can find the API key in your [User settings][api-key-url].

### Installation

The plugin is available from [JetBrains Marketplace][plugin-repo].
You can install it directly from your IDE via the `File | Settings/Preferences | Plugins` screen.
On the `Marketplace` tab simply search for `codegpt` and select the `CodeGPT` suggestion:

### API Key Configuration

After the plugin has been successfully installed, the API key needs to be configured.

You can configure the key by going to the plugin's settings via the `File | Settings/Preferences | Tools | CodeGPT`.
On the settings panel simply click on the `API key` field, paste the key obtained from the OpenAI website and click `Apply/OK`:
